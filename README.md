# To-do-list

Total of 3-4 hours of work, had no experience before this one in any of html/css/js.

I used this tutorial as my main refrence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wCpkOk2uCg&t=2233s.

Most of the css code, i didn't understood very well as i'm looking forward to use bootstrap, but with some try and error i could figure out what every line can do.

As well as some searching for adding the edit feature, it's ain't pretty but i'm looking forward to make better ones.

Used VScode with the following features:
  - Auto close tag.
  - Auto rename tag.
  - Code runner.
  - JavaScript (ES6).
  - Live server "I recommend using it, it save so much time".

Also if you're new to VScode use this video to install it and customize it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THDTDTkyB1I&t=1s
